# DigiPen Graphics Library

This is a simple library to handle input, graphics, and the application window. The interface is designed for use in programs written in C.

A zip file with the current version of the library files can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/DigiPen-Graphics-Library/releases) page. 

The repository is structured as follows:
- The header, `.DLL`, and `.lib` files can be found in the [DGL folder](./DGL/). The current released version of this folder is on the [Releases](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/DigiPen-Graphics-Library/releases) page. 
- The [DGL Template Project](./DGL_Template_Project/) is set up to access the files in the DGL folder and can be used as an example of Visual Studio project settings. There is also a documentation page on [creating new Visual Studio projects](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/DigiPen-Graphics-Library/wiki/Visual-Studio-Projects).
- The [DigiPen Graphics Library folder](./DigiPen_Graphics_Library/) contains the source code for the DGL. 
- `DGL.sln` in the root folder is a solution which contains both the template and the DGL projects.

Documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/DigiPen-Graphics-Library/wiki) or in the [docs folder](./docs/).

Feel free to create issues for bug reports or feature requests, or to submit pull requests, either for the code or for the documentation.
